# Recommender Systems <br>
In this notebook, I practiced building different types of recommender systems using the Pandas library and various machine learning algorithms.<br>
<br>
## Part 1 - Popularity-Based Recommenders 
Our main goal in this section is to develop a recommender system that suggests restaurants to consumers. Initially, I started with 2 dataset from University of California, Irvine <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data"> "Restaurant & consumer data" </a>. To achieve my goal, I made a popularity-based recommender that works based on popularity of restaurants among users. The assumption is that the restaurant that has the highest counts of rating is the most popular. The downside to this method is that it cannot produce personalized results. By Looking at the rating counts, I found the top 5 popular places. Then, I looked out the cuisine of top 5 rated restaurant which turned out most of them are mexican. Looks <br>

## Part 2 - Correlation-Based Recommenders
Here, I continue my efforts in building a recommender system that offers the best possible options to consumers. I decided to make a correlation-based recommender which Unlike popularity-based system, do take users preferences into account. In correlation-based recommendation systems, items are recommended based on users reviews. In other words, it chooses the items based on how well the items correlates with other items with respect to users ratings. Correlation-based recommendation systems use Pearson's R correlation to offer the items which are most similar to the past chosen items by users.<br>
In this section, I added another dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data"> same source </a> which provides name, address, and other details about the restaurants. I seperated the place ID and name column to merge with the previous datasets. Then, I calculated the average rating that each place is given. I also counted the number of ratings for each place to see how popular each place is. I found that there has been 130 unique places that have been reviewed in the dataframe. A restaurant that called 'Tortas Locas Hipocampo' from mexican cuisine has the highest amount of ratings. I was curious to see what restaurants are the most similar to Tortas so I can recommend them to consumers. So, I canculated the correlation between user's rating to Tortas and other restaurants. I got a list of restaurants with their Pearson's R value. After careful post processing, I recommended Restaurante 'El Reyecito' to the users who like 'Tortas'. This process is reproducible with any other restaurant.<br>

## Part 3. Classification-Based Collaborative Filtering (Machine Learning Based Recommenders - Logistic Regression)
Here, I wanted to build a system that can help banks to decide which new users they should offer their banking system to. So, I developed a classification-based collaborative filtering system which is able to make personlized recommendations since it is taking into the account the users attributes as well as purchase history and other contextual data(e.g. browser history). The data of this section has been obtained from University of California, Irvine <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing">" Bank Marketing Data Set "</a>. 
To predict the clinets that have the highest chance of accepting the bank offer, I focused on the clinet dataset and used logistic regression algorithm to train the model. The model have been evaluated and tested with various metrics (e.g. precision, recall, f1-score). I got 89% accuracy with my model. By deploying this model, 

## Part 4. Collaborative Filtering System
In this section, I aimed to recommend movies to the users based on the previous movies that they enjoyed. The recommender system that I made in this section was collaborative filtering which works based on reactions by similar users. To build that, I start by obtaining two dataset from <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/">"grouplens of University of Minnesota"</a>. I merged the two dataset and then I made a <b> utility matrix </b> by dividing the data in to two categories: the users and the items. Each user likes certain items, and the rating value rij (from 1 to 5) is the data associated with each user i and item j and represents how much the user appreciates the item. By using the TruncatedSVD from Sci-Kit Learn, I decomposed a utility matrix into three compressed matrices. It was very useful as it provides efficiency to not refer back to the original dataset. In addition, SVD provides latent variables that are available and affecting the behaviour of a dataset. In the next step, I used Pearsonâ€™s R correlation coefficient to find out how similar each movie to other movies on the basis of user tastes. As an example, I isolated STAR WARS movie to find the next best movie for Star Wars lovers. Below is the list of results that I got:

## Part 5. Content_based Recommender
In the last section, I was curious to make a recommender system that can recommend items based on certain attributes. In here, I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ruiromanini/mtcars"> mtcars dataset from kaggle </a>. In this sense, if a client tell you the his/her prefernce in finding a car with certain numbers of cylinders, forward gears, carburetor, etc, you will be able to recommend the best car from the dataset that matches the client's preferences. In order to do that, I used the nearest neighbors algorithm to train the model.
